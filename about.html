    <h2>What is Calisthenics?</h2>
    <p>Calisthenics is a form of exercise that uses your own body weight to build strength, endurance, flexibility, and coordination. It includes movements like pull-ups, push-ups, dips, squats, and advanced holds such as handstands and muscle-ups. It requires little to no equipment and helps you develop complete control of your body while improving both physical and mental health.</p>
